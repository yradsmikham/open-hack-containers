# Challenge 2 - Let's get ready to cluster!


## Background
Containers are extremely useful on their own, but their flexibility and potential is multiplied when deployed to an orchestrator/cluster.

You can learn more about the value of orchestrators at [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com), or more specifically the following links:

- [Service Fabric and Containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-containers-overview)
- [Introduction to Azure Container Service (AKS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes)

Once you have a cluster configured, you can react quickly to demand and leverage the extended functionality of the underlying platform to best suit your needs whether that's:

- Deploying quickly and reliably.
- Scaling on at will to meet demand.
- Rolling out new features or upgrades.
- Utilizing only what resources you need for your current provision.

## Challenge

Your team's goal in this challenge is to deploy the same container you used in challenge 1, to a cluster in Azure either with [Service Fabric](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/) or [Azure Container Service (AKS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/) in the _EastUS_ Azure region.

## Success Criteria

- Create a cluster in Azure, running v1.0 of your chosen container, in the _EastUS_ Azure region.

- You can find the Minecraft containers [on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/openhack/minecraft-server/)
- HINT: There is a second port on a Minecraft server for RCON (Remote Console) **25575**, in addition to the default connection port (25565). The hack portal uses this to verify your server!!
